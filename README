The code applies the proposed active learning method [1] to USPS Handwritten Digit Recognition dataset [2]. It is written in MATLAB R2013a. It uses the SGWT toolbox [3] which is also included. 

To run the code, simply unpack the directory and run main_usps.m. If you have any questions, please email agadde at usc dot edu.
